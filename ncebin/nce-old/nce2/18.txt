After I had had lunch at a village inn, I
looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair
beside the door and now it wasn't there !
As I was looking for it, the inn-keeper
came in.
'Did you have a good meal ?' he asked.
'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I
can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'
The inn-keeper smiled and imme-
diately went out. In a few minutes he
returned with my bag and gave it back to
me.
'I'm very sorry,' he said ' My dog had
taken it into the garden. He often does
this.'
