The secretary told me that Mr Harms-
worth would see me. I felt very nervous
when. I went into his office. He did not
look up from his desk when I entered.
After I had sat down, he said that busi-
ness was very bad. He told me that the
firm could not afford to pay such large
salaries. Twenty people had already left.
I knew that my turn had come.
'Mr Harmsworth,' I said in a weak
voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he Said.
Then he smiled and told me I would
receive an extra &100 a year!
